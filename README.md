rapid.io intergration
rapid.io is being used for all 3 places, 
1) The iot device is sending data to Android, this is to ensure the battery can be sustained through solar.  The Android then sends the data to IoT devices.
2) The map is using rapid.io Javascript API to populate the heatmap
3) The iOS is being used for simulation and purging of the data.
